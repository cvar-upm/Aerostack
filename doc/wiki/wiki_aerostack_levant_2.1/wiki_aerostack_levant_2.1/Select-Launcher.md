The launcher is a file that specifies the architecture of processes that will be executed for a particular aerial robot system. The available launchers in Aerostack are in the folder `${AEROSTACK_STACK}/launchers`. Next table shows examples of launchers (.sh files) that you can find in this folder and are ready to be used.

| Launcher  |   Description  |  
| :-----------| :--------- | 
| simulated_quadrotor_basic.sh |Architecture of processes for Drone Simulator|			
| ardrone_basic.sh |Architecture of processes for AR Drone 2.0|
| ardrone_visual_marker_localization.sh |Architecture of processes for AR Drone 2.0 using visual markers for self-localization|
