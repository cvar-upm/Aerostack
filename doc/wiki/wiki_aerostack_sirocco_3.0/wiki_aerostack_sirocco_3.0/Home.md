##  Latest news:

**[March 5, 2020]** We are very proud to announce that our group CVAR (Computer Vision and Aerial Robotics) from the “Universidad Politecnica de Madrid” [won the third place](https://vimeo.com/399391178/ea9e29efa0) of the Grand Challenge in the [International Robotic Competition MBZIRC 2020](https://www.mbzirc.com) that took place in February 25, 2020. The Aerostack software framework was successfully used for building the system architecture of aerial robots that participated in the competition as it described in [this publication](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339725858_The_Skyeye_Team_Participation_in_the_2020_Mohamed_Bin_Zayed_International_Robotics_Challenge).

Our group CVAR participated as the coordinator of SkyTeam, a combined team that also integrated members from Universidad Pablo Olavide and Poznan University of Technology. The group SkyTeam was in charge of Challenge 1 and Challenge 3. The group French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) was in charge of Challenge 2. Congratulations to all the members of these groups!

**[July 30, 2019]** We are pleased to announce the release of Aerostack **Version 3.0 Distribution Sirocco**. The development of this new version has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the [project ROSIN](http://rosin-project.eu). Compared to previous versions, it includes the following main features:

- **Standard methods:** Components of Aerostack have been updated to use standard ROS message types. Aerostack has been also updated to operate with ROS Melodic Morenia and Ubuntu 18.04. 

- **New license and improved portability:** The [software license of Aerostack](https://github.com/Vision4UAV/Aerostack/wiki/License) has been changed to BSD-3. The [installation method](https://github.com/Vision4UAV/Aerostack/wiki/Install-Aerostack) has also been improved using projects that install subsets of Aerostack packages. 

- **Improved efficiency:** The performance efficiency and maintainability of the executive system has been improved with [a more efficient design](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1631%2FFITEE.1800552). The [graphical user interface](https://github.com/Vision4UAV/Aerostack/wiki/Graphical-User-Interface) has been divided into separate more efficient and simpler ROS nodes. 

- **New capabilities for navigation and communication:** [New behaviors](https://github.com/Vision4UAV/Aerostack/wiki/Catalog-of-Behaviors) for positioning and navigation based on lidar sensors have been developed reusing existing ROS packages, and Aerostack has been extended to operate with Gazebo simulator (RotorS). New behaviors have been developed for communication between the robot and the operator and between the robot and other robots. 

- **Learning documentation:** New test scenarios with increasing complexity have been developed. These scenarios have used to create [new learning documentation](https://github.com/Vision4UAV/Aerostack/wiki/Example-projects) to facilitate the use of Aerostack.
